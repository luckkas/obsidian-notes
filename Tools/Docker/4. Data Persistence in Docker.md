Containers are ephemeral by default, which means any data stored in the container will be lost once it is terminated. To overcome this problem and retain data across container lifecycles, Docker provides various data persistence methods.


# Docker Volumes

Docker volumes are the preferred way to persist data generated and utilized by a Docker container. A volume is a directory on the host machine Docker uses to store files and directories that can outlive the container’s lifecycle.

To create a volume:

```
docker volume create volume_name
```

To use a volume on container:

```
docker run --volume volume_name:/container/path image_name
```

# Bind Mounts

Bind mounts allow you to map any directory on the host machine to a directory within the container. This method can be __useful in development environments__ where you need to modify files on the host system, and those __changes should be immediately__ available within the container.

To create a bind mount:

```
docker run --mount type=bind,src=/host/path,dst=/container/path image_name
```

# Docker tmpfs mounts

Docker tmpfs mounts allow you to create a temporary file storage directly in the container’s memory.

To use tmpfs mount:

```
docker run --tmpfs /container/path image_name
```
