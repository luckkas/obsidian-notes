# Highlights

* **Linux Containers (LXC)**: is a lightweight virtualization solution that allows multiple isolated Linux systems to run on a single host without the need for a full-fledged hypervisor.

* **Control Groups (cgroups)**: is a Linux kernel feature that allows the allocation and management of resources like CPU, memory, and I/O.

* **Union File Systems (UnionFS)**: UnionFS is a file system service that allows the overlaying of multiple file systems in a single, unified view.

* **Namespaces:** are another Linux kernel feature that provides process isolation. They allow Docker to create isolated workspaces called containers. 


# Getting a context

## Namespace

There are several types of namespaces in Linux, including:

- **PID (Process IDs)**: Isolates the process ID number space, which means that processes within a container only see their own processes, not those on the host or in other containers.

- **Network (NET)**: Provides each container with a separate view of the network stack, including its own network interfaces, routing tables, and firewall rules.

- **Mount (MNT)**: Isolates the file system mount points in such a way that each container has its own root file system, and mounted resources appear only within that container.

- **UTS (UNIX Time Sharing System)**: Allows each container to have its own hostname and domain name, separate from other containers and the host system.

- **User (USER)**: Maps user and group identifiers between the container and the host, so different permissions can be set for resources within the container.

- **IPC (Inter-Process Communication)**: Allows or restricts the communication between processes in different containers.
